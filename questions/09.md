# Events: Forms

Consider the following code; whenever we fire the `submit` on the form below, the whole page refreshes. What line of code could we add to stop this from happening?

`form.addEventListener('submit', submitForm)`

&nbsp;

`function submitForm(event){`

`Â  console.log(event)`

`}`

## Correct

event.preventDefault()
