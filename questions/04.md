# Events: DOMContentLoaded

Select true or false. Given the following HTML:

```html
lang="en">
  
    <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"index.js"</span><span class="nt">>
  
  
    Hello!
```

And the following JavaScript code in the `index.js` file:

```javascript
const h1 = document.querySelector("h1");
console.log(h1.textContent);
```

The JavaScript code would throw an error.

## Correct

True

> Correct! Since the `` tag comes before the `` element in the HTML document, the
> `` element won't be loaded in the DOM by the time our JavaScript code runs. That
> means our `querySelector` will return `null`, so we'll get an error `Cannot read
> properties of null`. We could prevent this error by listening for the
> `DOMContentLoaded` before accessing elements from the DOM in our code.
