# Events: DOMContentLoaded

Select true or false. Given the following HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <script src="index.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

And the following JavaScript code in the `index.js` file:

```javascript
const h1 = document.querySelector("h1");
console.log(h1.textContent);
```

The JavaScript code able would throw an error.

## Correct

True

> Correct! Since the `<script>` tag comes before the `<h1>` element in the HTML
> document, the `<h1>` element won't be loaded in the DOM by the time our
> JavaScript code runs. That means our `querySelector` will return `null`, so
> we'll get an error `Cannot read properties of null`. We could prevent this
> error by listening for the `DOMContentLoaded` before accessing elements from
> the DOM in our code.
