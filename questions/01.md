# Events: addEventListener()

Which of the following snippets would change the `.character-div` element's
position on the page?

```javascript
let character = document.querySelector(".character-div");
```

## Correct

```javascript
document.addEventListener("keydown", function (event) {
  if (event.key === "ArrowLeft") {
    const leftNumbers = character.style.left.replace("px", "");
    const left = parseInt(leftNumbers, 10);
    character.style.left = `${left - 1}px`;
  }
});
```

> Correct! We are conditionally changing the `character.style.left` to move the
> character. Well done!

## Incorrect

```javascript
document.addEventListener("keydown", function (event) {
  character.move(left);
});
```

> Try again! While this seems like an easy answer, we haven't been provided with
> a `move` method, so this option likely won't work!

## Incorrect

```javascript
document.addEventListener("keydown", function (event) {
  if (event.key === "ArrowLeft") {
    const leftNumbers = character.style.left.replace("px", "");
    const left = parseInt(leftNumbers, 10);
    console.log(character.style.left);
  }
});
```

> Try again! While this option is close, we aren't actually moving our
> `character` element anywhere!

## Incorrect

I don't know.
