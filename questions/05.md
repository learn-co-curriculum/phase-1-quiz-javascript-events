# Events: Event Types

Kiyana wants to make the character in their game jump every time the user
presses the space bar. What event would make the most sense to listen for in the
following JavaScript code?

```javascript
document.addEventListener("______", characterJump);
function characterJump(event) {
  if (event.code === "Space") {
    console.log("JUMP!");
  }
}
```

Fill in the blank next to `addEventListener` in the code above.
